 * The purpose of this program is to find the tour of a knight on a chessboard
   using a brute force recursive algorithm. A knight's tour is a sequence of moves 
   of a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square once and 
   only once. So given the size of the board and a starting position it shows
   how the knight would move to complete its tour. Its starting spot would be labeled 
   with a 1 and the next move would be labeled as 2 and so on. If the n was equal to 8,
   the final step would be 64 (8x8).
  
 * There are 2 ways to run the program, both via command line arguments. If one arg is 
   given, the Knight's Tour is calculated according to instructions given by the user
   through the terminal. Options are displayed to the user from which the user can 
   accordingly select his/her preferences. Option 2 takes information of multiple tours
   from a file and outputs the tours from this information to a specific output file.
